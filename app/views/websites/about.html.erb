  <h1>About TOS Fairness</h1>

  <p>Most online user agreements are stacked in favor of the corporation, and not in favor of the individual user.  We aim to change that, and keep it that way.  TOSfairness is a collective of volunteer attorneys and netizens focused on corporate transparency in murky 'click' agreements on the web, on phones, on games, and online.</p>

  <p>No one (and we mean NO ONE) reads every word of every agreement before joining a new website or agreeing to new terms of service, whether on a computer, or on your phone.  Well, until now.  Now, we read and rate as many of them for you as we can, in order of demand, so you can feel safer signing them.  Awesome, right?  You're welcome.</p>

  <p>Brought to you by Break Diving, Inc. a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit with one primary mission: helping individuals succeed in life.  It follows that in order for people to succeed in life, they should know exactly what they are actually signing.  Right?  Let's get started!</p>

  <p>The Terms of Service Fairness Project is a wholly owned subsidiary project of Break Diving, Inc., a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization headquartered in New York.</p>

  <p>TOS Fairness grew out of founder and attorney Monroe Mann's increasing frustration with the American court system as well as the absolutely horrifically unfair online terms of services that people were unknowingly or unwittingly signing.</p>  

  <p>While it may be possible to fight each and every company in each and every state and in each and every country, it would take decades, require thousands and thousands of plaintiffs, and inevitably, many unfair terms of service agreements would slip under the courts' radars.  Equally importantly, many judges are just not that accurate (or are downright partisan) in their decisions, totally ignoring the facts.  Sadly, for these reasons, you often can't trust a judge to make the right decision.  Case in point: how did these click-to-agree agreements become legal in the first place?  So, instead of using our flawed legal system and the usually incompetent U.S. Congress to curb errant companies (which has not worked), our intent here is to help avoid online users from having to use the legal system or even hire an attorney in the first place--by encouraging companies to voluntarily make the terms of their agreements clear and fair, and upfront.</p>

  <p>So, instead of trying to use the legal system to fight these battles from the outside, Break Diving founder Dr. Monroe Mann, PhD, Esq, MBA, LLM, ME decided to fight these companies from the inside by creating the TOS Fairness Project: it is our hope that by using peer pressure and public awareness, we will be able to encourage companies to voluntarily update their terms of services to be more in favor of the consumer.  Those that don't, we hope, will lose business and good will to those companies that adhere to our online user bill of rights.</p>

  <p>Our ratings result from the tireless work of volunteer attorneys from around the world (who we hope to pay small stipends to eventually), as well as the candid feedback from actual users who interact with the terms of services in question every day.</p>

  <p>Thanks for visiting us, and please, spread the word.  The more people who know to come to TOSFairness prior to clicking "I agree", the better off the world will be!</p>
