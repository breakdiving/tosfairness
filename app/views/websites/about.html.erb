  <h1>About TOS Fairness</h1>

  <p>The Terms of Service Fairness Project is a wholly owned subsidiary project of Break Diving, Inc., a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization headquartered in New York.</p>

  <p>TOS Fairness grew out of founder and attorney Monroe Mann's increasing frustration with the American court system as well as the absolutely horrifically unfair online terms of services that people were unknowingly or unwittingly signing.</p>  

  <p>While it may be possible to fight each and every company in each and every state and in each and every country, it would take decades, require thousands and thousands of plaintiffs, and inevitably, many unfair terms of service agreements would slip under the courts' radars.  Equally importantly, many judges are just not the brightest of people or are downright partisan in their decisions.  Sadly, for these reasons, you often can't trust a judge to make the right decision anymore.  In other words, instead of using our flawed legal system and the U.S. Congress to curb errant companies (which has not worked), our intent here is to help avoid online users from having to use the legal system or even hire an attorney in the first place--by encouraging companies to voluntarily make the terms of their agreements clear and fair, and upfront.</p>

  <p>So, instead of trying to use the legal system to fight these battles from the outside, Break Diving founder Dr. Monroe Mann, PhD, Esq, MBA, LLM, ME decided to fight these companies from the inside by creating the TOS Fairness Project: by using peer pressure and public awareness, our intent is to encourage companies to voluntarily update their terms of services to be more in favor of the consumer.  Those that don't, we hope, will lose business and good will to those companies that adhere to our online user bill of rights.</p>

  <p>Our ratings result from the tireless work of volunteer attorneys from around the world (who we hope to pay small stipends to eventually), as well as the candid feedback from actual users who interact with the terms of services in question every day.</p>
